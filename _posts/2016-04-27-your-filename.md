In Fall 2015, a workshop was held to understand better how the Alaskan stream temperature community currently manages their data. While some State and Federal agencies have their own data formats and data management guidelines, many smaller data collecting entities do not have compatible protocols or databases.  As a result, State and Federal agencies are unlikely to be able to host and distribute the data of their smaller partners, yet all partner data are important for assessing landscape or regional level change occuring throughout Alaska. The workshop addressed five questions: 1) What are the essential metadata and formatting requirements for non-agency data to be aggregated with agency data?, 2) How can we utilize existing resources and platforms to harvest/access and store environmental data from a wide variety of stakeholders for multi-scale analyeses?, 3) What lessons, barriers and sollutions can we learn from recent statewide and national efforts?, 4) What are the data provider requirements for dissemination and usage of this data?, 5) How can we increase reliability and sustainability (both financially and in terms of partner buy-in) of such data systems? The presentation will focus on the workshop participants' answers to these questions.
