Northern Latitudes partners came together to strategically and deliberately
expand cross-LCC collaboration, and to develop a strong, shared narrative
focused on benefits to people.  Northern Latitudes is an executive committee for
the Alaska and Northwest Canada Landscape Conservation Cooperatives (LCCs). In
addition to representatives from USGS' Alaska Climate Science Center, it also
includes steering committee chairs and staff for the following LCCs: Aleutian
and Bering Sea Islands, Arctic, North Pacific, Northwest Boreal, and Western
Alaska.
