<p class="lead">Northern Latitudes - leadership of the five LCCs within Alaska and Northern Canada
and the Alaska Climate Science Center staff - represents shared conservation
priorities of hundreds of organizations: federal and state agencies, non-governmental
organizations, and Tribes/First Nations across nearly 12 million square kilometers of
vast and largely intact landscapes of Alaska and Northwest Canada.</p>

These social - ecological systems support unique natural and cultural resources that are
valued by the public. The tundra, boreal forest, mountain ranges and marine
environments are home to millions of migratory birds, hundreds of thousands of caribou,
some of the world’s largest salmon runs, and many of the planet’s marine mammals. 

While the human footprint is relatively small, it’s a region experiencing unprecedented
change. A warming climate and land use changes are rapidly altering these social-
ecological systems, requiring us to approach conservation in innovative ways.

# Conservation without Boundaries

[Landscape Conservation Cooperatives (LCC)](https://lccnetwork.org/) - self-directed conservation
partnerships - bring holistic, collaborative strategies to help ensure the ability of
landscapes to sustain natural and cultural resources for current and future generations.
Alaska’s five LCCs work across agency and jurisdictional boundaries to identify and
achieve desired conservation outcomes.

Although they are identified by large geographies, often conservation issues span more
than one LCC’s area. Northern Latitudes addresses those issues and works in close
partnership with the Alaska Climate Science Center to generate information and tools
needed to address challenges related to climate change.
